.TH DWARFDUMP
.SH NAME
readelfobj \- dumps ELF object headers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B readelfobj [options] \f2objectfilename\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B readelfobj
command prints and checks ELF object file headers.
With no options (but with the required \f2objectfilename\fP)
all headers print and a short report of space wasted
in the object prints at the end.
.PP
Elf files are read from first-principles using
standard C functions (libelf is not used).
Full checking of all fields for sanity
ensures objects with bad headers are detected and
reported.
.PP
The format is intended to be human readable.
.B readelfobj
only prints details of a few types of section.
.SH PRINTING OPTIONS
.TP
.B \--only-wasted-summary
Suppresses header printing while printing
a report of space wasted in the object file.
A few bytes wasted is not serious (it can
be due to alignment requirements specified
by the compiler) but
thousands of bytes might suggest a
compiler issue.
Data at the end of the file not referenced by any header
could mean something has hidden some data at the end.

.TP
.B \--print-dynamic
Print the .dynamic section in detail.

.TP
.B \--print-relocs
Print relocation sections in detail.

.TP
.B \--print-symtabs
Print Elf symbol tables in detail.

.TP
.B \--print-wasted
Expands the  wasted-space output
to include details of all
the section/segment data blocks
sorted by file offset.

.TP
.B \--all
Selects all the above options except \--only-wasted-summary.

.SH NOTES
dwarfdump(1) can show the details of DWARF2,3,4 or 5
section information.
.P
GNU readelf(1) is essential to show  the content
of the section contents that readelfobj does not print.
.SH BUGS
Relocation, dynamic section, and symtab section
printing shows the records of each but may not
expand the machine-specific fields into the
expected strings.
.P
Traditional archive-format (ar) files are not
understood by readelfobj.  This will not be fixed.
