    * dwarfstring.c: Removed a trailing space character.
    * readobjmacho.c: Fixed an indentation error.
    * readelfobj.c(elf_print_symbols): Now prints the string
      length of the symbol name (it is often zero) and
      if zero prints  name-length  0: <no name> .
      The length of the symbol name is in bytes. If the
      name string contains European or Japanese or 
      multi-byte  UTF-8 characters those are translated
      to a uri-style output (as has been true all along)
      so the character count printed might vary somewhat
      from the byte count of the string.
      Then Changing spelling of empty name to <no-name>
