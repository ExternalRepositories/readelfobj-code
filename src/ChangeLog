     * readelfobj.c: If fopen() fails and errno is set
       report the errno in the failure message.

     * dwarf_object_read_common.c(dwarf_object_read_random):
       Documented that off_t and ssize_t (though not in
       C90) are in early POSIX (ISO/IEC 9954-1:1990).

     * dwarf_load_elf_headers.c: Removed unused locals.
     * readelfobj.c: Removed unused locals and now use
       UNUSEDARG in one place to eliminate a compiler warning.
     * dwarf_object_read_common.h,dwarf_object_read_common.c:
       Parts of dwarf_object_read_random() were not
       correctly typed nor were read errors correctly checked for.
       A 2.2GB object file is now properly handled.
2010-01-14: David Anderson
     * dwarf_reading.h: Delete definition of uint64_t as
       that definition is never used.
2010-01-06: David Anderson
     * dwarf_object_detector.c: Remove useless call to stat().
     * readelfobj.c: Added 3 ifdef-defines so elf.h
       need not be present.

     * dwarf_elf_naming.c,dwarf_load_elf_headers.c,dwarf_machoread.c,
       readelfobj.c,readelfobj.h,readobjmacho.c: All use
       Dwarf_Unsigned for commonality with libdwarf/dwarfdump
       type naming.
2019-01-01  David Anderson
     * dwarf_elf_naming.c,dwarf_load_elf_headers.c,
       readelfobj.c,readelfobj.h: Fix indents, remove
       trailing whitespace.
