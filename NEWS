  Now nothing here depends on elf.h (though it will
  be #included if it exists) or libelf.
  Known to build with ./configure on 32 and 64bit Linux and
  also (running sh) on MinGW.
  Use 'make check' to verify correct behavior.

  In All Environments:
  Since git repositories do not record timestamps
  after copying files from a git repository (or off of a
  device (USB etc)) a 'configure' or 'make' may fail
  to work entirely correctly.
  From the readelfobj directory do
    sh scripts/FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES
  to restore a sensible set of file timestamps 
  for 'configure' and 'make' to work.
  The scripts/FIX-CONFIGURE-TIMES script is always safe to run.
