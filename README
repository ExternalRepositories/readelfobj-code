readelfobj is a program that reads elf object files
and prints the header information.
It also checks for certain errors including
wasted space in the object files.

It does not depend on any object-file
specific Elf, Mach-o or Windows libraries or headers.

It also dumps Elf relocation sections and Elf symtab
sections and dynamic.

To dump DWARF section contents one should use 
dwarfdump or GNU readelf.

In All Environments:
  Since git repositories do not record timestamps
  after copying files from a git repository (or off of a
  device (USB etc)) a 'configure' or 'make' may fail
  to work entirely correctly.
  From the readelfobj directory do
    sh scripts/fixdate.sh
  to restore a sensible set of file timestamps
  for 'configure' and 'make' to work.
  The scripts/fixdate.sh script is always safe to run.

To update configure, update configure.ac and/or
one or more Makefile.am and do, in the top level
directory:
  autoreconf -vif
