readelfobj is a program that reads elf object files
and prints the header information.
It also checks for certain errors including
wasted space in the object files.

It relies on a minimal elf.h but it does not
depend on any library except standard libc.

It also dumps relocation sections and Elf symtab
sections.

To dump DWARF section contents one should use 
dwarfdump or GNU readelf, not readelfobj.


To update configure, update configure.ac and/or
one or more Makefile.am and do, in the top level
directory:
  autoreconf -vif
