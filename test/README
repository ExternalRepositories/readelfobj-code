All tests assume readelfobj (version to test)
is copied to this directlry by PICKUP
or something else

Testobject
libkrb5support.so.0.1.debug is from libdwarf regressiontests
      in the directory hughes.

The .dynamic section of this object starts out with
a string, something not mentioned by the Elf standard,
so unless something new has been added to the standard
(how is that possible?) the object file shows a bug. ?
