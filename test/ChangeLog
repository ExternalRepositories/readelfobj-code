    * SHALIAS.sh: New, so one can use a local SHALIAS.sh
      where one needs an alias for make when running tests
      so one gets gnu make. (as on FreeBSD, for example)
    * runtests.sh: Now sources SHALIAS.sh

    * test010.sh,test015p.sh: These two scripts were slightly wrong
      so only worked as intended from one directory. oops. Fixed
    * test010.base,test015p.base: Slightly different baselines,
      now the way they should look.

    * test*.sh: All now deal with doing a 'make check' out-of-tree.
      and added test022 and test023.
      make check is also working under windows ( I use
      configure --enable-nonstandardprintf, you may or may not
      need to use the --enable-nonstandardprintf)

    * Makefile.am: Making 'make dist' work.
    * Makefile.in: Regenerated.

    * test003.base,test004.base,test005.base,test006.base,test017.base:
      New baselines reflecting the reporting on .gnu_debuglink
      and .note.gnu.build-id (only the latter appears in
      the currect testcases).

    * test*.base: Nearly all the tests use dos2unix
      and the -q option is not always available.
      So dropped -q and use 2>/dev/null instead.

    * test003.base,test017.base, test019.base,test020.base,
      test021.base : to match latest elf reader.

    * test020.*: A test with MIPS64 object (special relocation content). 
    * test021.*: A test with SPARCV9 object (special relocation content).

    * A new year.
